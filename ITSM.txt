ITSM 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IT service management (ITSM) is a general term that describes a  approach to design, deliver, manage and improve the way businesses use information technology (IT). ITSM includes all the IT activities and processes that support a service throughout its lifecycle, from 
1)service management to change management,
2)problem and incident management, 
3)asset management, 
4)knowledge management.

An IT service enables access to information and processes to accomplish important business goals. 

IT services include the deployment and support of enterprise applications. 

IT teams must create, deploy, manage, optimize and potentially retire each service, with input from the business. 

Each service can have an associated service-level agreement (SLA), which codifies the expectations of performance and availability .the service should not fall below these expectations.

IT service delivery is generally discussed in terms of providers and customers, who interact via the IT service desk.

 An IT service provider selects, designs, deploys and operates the service. The provider can be an internal IT department or a third-party specialist. An IT service customer is any consumer of those services, such as the employee who accesses email through the organization's Exchange Outlook interface. IT organizations generally offer customers an IT service catalog, a list or menu of available services.

There are many roles within the IT service desk. IT services typically start with a need and strategy, and this demands clear guidance from business and IT leaders. 

Services must then be architected and deployed, requiring the expertise of IT hardware and software application engineers. 

Services must be monitored and tracked, and problems remediated by IT administrators and helpdesk staff.



ITSM processes
To manage IT services, organizations must control the service's capabilities, how it performs, changes to it and what happens when it experiences problems. 

These processes fall under several main categories, primarily defined by ITIL, but appearing in various forms in the other ITSM frameworks.

Change management. When a service is out of step with business expectations, it must be modified, expanded or otherwise altered. IT must determine how these changes will affect the service deployment, implement them appropriately, then monitor if the changes have the intended effect. Release management can be grouped with change management or treated as a separate process.

Asset management. Services require software and hardware assets to function. These assets should be tracked, updated appropriately and mapped to show how they interact. 

Configuration management, capacity management and asset management deal with these concerns and can be blended or separate processes.

Project management. IT services transition between various stages of the lifecycle at different times and different speeds. Project management skills enable IT organizations to maintain orderly services and avoid problems such as outdated systems or shadow IT.

Knowledge management. Knowledge management crosses into the other ITSM processes, and is a way to avoid duplicated work and discovery by organizing and making available information about IT services.

Incident management. When an IT service is disrupted by performance issues or an outage, the IT service desk must address the issue, restore service availability and make improvements and codify procedures to prevent reoccurrence.

Problem management. A problem is the root cause of an incident. An IT organization might remediate an incident but not fix the problem, leading to future incidents. Therefore, problem management is a way to permanently fix issues to improve service delivery and performance.

1)Splunk
---------------------
Splunk is basically an American Multinational corporation that came into existence in the year 2003. The basic idea behind this foundation was developing a software that can search, monitor and analyze machine generated big data. Splunk, the product itself, manages and moulds real-time data into searchable repository. This can be used to take up many tasks such as generation of reports, graphs, dashboards, alerts and visualizations, etc.


What is Splunk?
Splunk is a digital platform that makes machine data accessible, usable, and valuable for everyone. It is an advance technology which is potent and scalable in nature, and is effectively able to search and index log data in the system. 

It analyzes machine generated data in real-time to provide operational intelligence. As there is exponential growth in IT and its machines, handling data is one big challenge where Splunk plays very vital role. The very features of Splunk is are as follows:

It deals with the data which is complex to understand.
It manages data which is in unstructured format.
It deals with data which is not useful for any analysis and visualization.

Assume that you are a System Administrator and you have to figure out what’s wrong in the system. It will simply take hours of time to find out the troublemaker, and if you are working for an MNC, it is nearly impossible to get it out. Machine data in unstructured format, is complex to understand and is strictly not suitable to make analysis or visualization. Now, this is where Splunk comes into the picture.

You can simply let it do all the dirty work for you i.e. data processing. After extracting the relevant data, it will be a lot more easier to locate the problems. Real time processing is its biggest selling point, as it is the bottleneck of data movement. Apart from this, there are many advantages associated with Splunk. Kindly take a look at the following points given below:

It is a kind of Google for log file browsing. 
Searches using simple terms with search processing language (SPL).
Splunk system has direct storage facility, which means there’s no backend storage required.
You can input data in any format i.e. json, .csv, or any other format.
You can assign Alerts/Events in Splunk.
You can make a precise estimation of the resources you need to scale up the infrastructure.
The biggest achievement of Splunk is that it has never encountered a single failure. Apart from this, it has many other impressive features like easy installation, easy scalability, retention without losing granularity, etc. Moreover, Splunk behaviour analytics allows it to spot threats that arise due to user behaviour.
